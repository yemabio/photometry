# photometry

This package is for processing fiber photometry data contained in doric files. 

To install, you must first have Python and conda already installed. Clone the repo, navigate to the home directory, and in the command line run 

```
conda env create --name photometry --file=environment_mac.yml
```

then run 

```
pip install -e .
```

This should complete the install. 

To use the module, you can refer to the ```analyze.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook in the ```scripts``` folder, which is a tutorial for comparing saline and CNO conditions.
